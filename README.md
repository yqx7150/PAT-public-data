Traditional reconstruction algorithms use acoustic inversion analytical methods to reconstruct, such as time domain back-projection, time reversal, delayed summation, etc. To obtain high-quality imaging, one can utilize multi-element ultrasound detectors, such as a full-ring detector, spherical detection array, ring detection array, or planar detection array. Of course, this will make the system more complex and more expensive. Therefore, we use a single-probe photoacoustic system, which uses a rotating stage to drive the probe to rotate to different angles to collect photoacoustic signals, and then uses the collected photoacoustic data to reconstruct the image using a back-projection algorithm.
